# Updates the number of cars in each location from one week to the next. 
# Precondition:  the variables a and b contain the number of cars in each 
# location at the beginning of the week.
# Postcondition:  a and b have been modified to reflect the number of cars
# that moved.

aRate <- 0.05; # Rate of cars in Albany dropped off in Boston
bRate <- 0.03; # Rate of cars in Boston dropped off in Albany

aMove <- round(aRate * a); # Number of cars moved from Albany to Boston
bMove <- round(bRate * b); # Number of cars moved from Boston to Albany

a <- a - aMove + bMove # Number of cars remaining in Albany
b <- b - bMove + aMove # Number of cars remaining in Boston
print(a)
print(b)
