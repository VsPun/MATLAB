% Physical Modeling in MATLAB by Allen B. Downey
% Chapter 2:  Scripts
% Exercise 2.1

% Computes the nth Fibonacci number.
% Precondition: you must assign a value to n before running this script. 
% Postcondition: the result is stored in ans.

t1 = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2;
t2 = (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2;
diff = t1^n - t2^n;
ans = diff / sqrt(5)
