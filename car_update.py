# Updates the number of cars in each location from one week to the next. 
# Precondition:  the variables a and b contain the number of cars in each 
# location at the beginning of the week.
# Postcondition:  a and b have been modified to reflect the number of cars
# that moved.

aRate = 0.05 # Rate of cars in Albany dropped off in Boston
bRate = 0.03 # Rate of cars in Boston dropped off in Albany

atob = round(aRate*a - bRate*b) # Number of cars moved from Albany to Boston

a = a - atob # Number of cars remaining in Albany
b = b + atob # Number of cars remaining in Boston

print "a = ", a
print "b = ", b
