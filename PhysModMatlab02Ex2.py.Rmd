Chapter 2:  Scripts

Exercise 2.2

MATLAB script translated into Python (via R)

Write a few lines of code that swap the values of x and y. 

Put your code in a script called swap and test it.

```{r, engine='python', comment=NA}
import sys

x =  1 
y = 10 

sys.argv = ['swap.py', 'x', 'y']
execfile('swap.py')

print "x = ", x
print "y = ", y
```
